Kendra LMS is an innovative online learning platform that connects learners with instructors from around the globe. 
As the project proposes, it‚Äôs more or less a mini-Udemy-like project to provide virtual learning experience to learners, and allow instructors present their skilled program/courses to prospective learners.
This is a web-based educational platform designed to facilitate online learning through dynamic course categorization, content delivery, and personalized learning paths. The platform mimics the structure of popular online learning websites (Udemy), allowing users to navigate through courses based on categories and subcategories, enhancing their learning experience.

## Introduction

Kendra LMS is designed to provide a seamless and engaging learning experience for both learners and instructors. The platform offers a variety of courses across different categories, allowing users to find and enroll in courses that match their interests and career goals.

## Features

- User Authentication
- Dynamic course categorization
- Personalized learning paths
- Interactive content delivery
- User-friendly navigation
- Instructor-led courses

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- You have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- You have installed [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Firebase Initialization

To initialize Firebase in your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add a new web app to your Firebase project.
3. Copy the Firebase configuration object provided by Firebase.

Create a file named `firebaseConfig.js` in your project and add your Firebase configuration:

```javascript
// firebaseConfig.js

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

export default firebaseConfig;
```
> But it's best to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add these configurations there. This approach helps keep your sensitive information secure and separate from your codebase. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` file**:
  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.

2. **Add your Firebase configuration**:
  Copy the Firebase configuration object and add it to the `.env` file in the following format:

  ```env
  REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
  REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com
  REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com
  REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
  REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
  REACT_APP_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
  REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID
  ```

3. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`**:
  To ensure that your sensitive information is not exposed in your version control system, add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file:

  ```sh
  echo ".env" >> .gitignore
  ```

4. **Use environment variables in your code**:
  Update your `firebaseConfig.js` file to use the environment variables:

  ```javascript
  // firebaseConfig.js

  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,
    authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,
    databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL,
    projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
    storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,
    messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
    appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID,
    measurementId: process.env.REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID
  };

  export default firebaseConfig;
  ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your sensitive configuration details are kept secure and are not accidentally shared in your code repository.


4. Initialize Firebase in your application:

```javascript
// index.js or App.js

import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';
import 'firebase/firestore';
import firebaseConfig from './firebaseConfig';

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Now you can use Firebase services, for example:
const auth = firebase.auth();
const db = firebase.firestore();
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the `firebaseConfig` object with your actual Firebase project configuration values.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

```sh
yarn run start
```

## Run tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```sh
yarn run test
```
